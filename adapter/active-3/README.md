Adapter PCB to support up to 3 panels
======================================

(work in progress)

   * Supports one panel for Raspberry PIs with 26 GPIO pins up to three
     panel chains for newer plus models and Raspberry Pi 2 that have 40 GPIO pins.
   * Uses HCT245 to level shift signals from 3.3V to 5V and shield
     the Raspberry Pi GPIOs from overloading.
   * Open source KiCAD PCB EDA format.
